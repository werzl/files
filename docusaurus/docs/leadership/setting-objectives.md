# Setting Objectives
Setting objectives should be a dialogue between the direct report and their manager.

Managers are accountable for making sure a SMART objective gets set, and the objective meets the best interests for the organisation AND the individual.

The direct report is responsible for proposing and forming an objective that aligns with their career goals.
