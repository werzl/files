# Useful Laws and Theories

- [**Conway’s law**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_law): The structure of any system designed by an organization is [isomorphic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isomorphism) to the structure of the organization. Consciously design your system architecture and your organisation hand in hand and let them evolve together.

- [**Dunbar’s number**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dunbar%27s_number): 150. The cognitive limit to the number of people with whom one can maintain stable social relationships — relationships in which an individual knows who each person is and how each person relates to every other person.

- [**Cynefin**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cynefin_framework): Offers five decision-making contexts or “domains” — *clear, complicated, complex, chaotic,* and *confusion* — to help people identify how they perceive situations and make sense of behavior.

- [**Jobs to Be Done Theory**](https://www.christenseninstitute.org/theory/jobs-to-be-done/): A theory that helps innovators understand how and why people make decisions.

- [**Parkinson’s law**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parkinson%27s_law): *Work expands so as to fill the time available for its completion.* Use shorter sprints, cycles, meetings, and timeboxes.

- [**Parkinson’s law of triviality**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parkinson%27s_law_of_triviality): The time spent on any agenda item is inversely proportional to the sum of money involved.

- [**Theory of Constraints**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theory_of_constraints): *A chain is no stronger than its weakest link.*  
  1. **Identify** the system constraint  
  2. **Exploit** the system’s constraint  
  3. **Subordinate** everything else to the above decision  
  4. **Elevate** the system’s constraint  
  5. Repeat

- [**Gall’s Law**](http://principles-wiki.net/principles:gall_s_law): A complex system that works is invariably found to have evolved from a simple system that worked. Don't build or fix a complex system as a whole. Start simple and evolve.

- [**Engelbart’s law**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Engelbart%27s_law): The intrinsic rate of human performance is [exponential](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exponential_growth). Start small and slow to "get better at getting better.”

- [**Little’s Law**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Little%27s_law): Service time is the [bottleneck](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bottleneck_(engineering)) that creates the queue.

- [**Strangler Fig Pattern**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strangler_fig_pattern): Wrap old code with the intent to redirect it to newer code — bonus points for [Skunk Works](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skunk_Works) cultural wrapping.

- [**Brooks’s law**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brooks%27s_law): *Adding manpower to a late software project makes it later.*

- [**Dunning–Kruger effect**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dunning%E2%80%93Kruger_effect): People who are unskilled in an area wrongly believe their ability is higher than average. They don’t know what they don’t know.

- [**Occam’s razor**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Occam%27s_razor): Entities must not be multiplied beyond necessity. Keep your teams as simple and small as possible.

- [**Pareto principle**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pareto_principle): For many phenomena, 80% of consequences stem from 20% of the causes.

- [**Vierordt’s law**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vierordt%27s_law): Retrospectively, short intervals of time tend to be overestimated, and long intervals underestimated.

- [**Larman’s Law**](https://www.craiglarman.com/wiki/index.php?title=Larman%27s_Laws_of_Organizational_Behavior): Organizations are implicitly optimized to avoid changing the status quo.

- [**Bus factor**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bus_factor): The "bus factor" is the minimum number of team members that have to suddenly disappear from a project before the project stalls due to lack of knowledgeable or competent personnel.
