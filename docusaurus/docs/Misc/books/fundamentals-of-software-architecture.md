# Fundamentals of Software Architecture
by Mark Richards & Neal Ford

This book examines:  
• Architecture patterns: The technical basis for many 
architectural decisions  
• Components: Identification, coupling, cohesion, partitioning, 
and granularity   
• Soft skills: Effective team management, meetings, negotiation, 
presentations, and more  
• Modernity: Engineering practices and operational approaches 
that have changed radically in the past few years  
• Architecture as an engineering discipline: Repeatable results, 
metrics, and concrete valuations that add rigor to software 
architecture

## Chapter 1
### Introduction
- There's no clear career path for Software Architects
- Martin Fowler whitepaper: https://martinfowler.com/ieeeSoftware/whoNeedsArchitect.pdf
  - > Architecture is about the important stuff…whatever that is.
- Architecture as a role is constantly changing, the wikipedia overview of Software Arch is out of date. 
- Earlier books about  architecture don’t consider DevOps because it didn’t exist when they were written.

### Defining Software Architecture
- Architecture Decisions
- Arhitecture Characteristics
- Design Principles

### Expectations of an Architect
#### Make Architecture Decisions
Ask whether the  decision is helping to guide teams in making the right choice or whether the decision makes the technical choice for them.

- Guide, dont specify
  - e.g: Guidance: use a reactive-based frontend framework. - Then work with the team to choose between React, Angluar, Vue etc.

#### Continually Analyze the Architecture
- Continuously assess if the architecture is still viable today
- Leads to structural decay if you don't
- Includes making Test and Release environments easy to use
- **Keep the application relevant**

#### Keep Current with Latest Trends

#### Ensure Compliance with Decisions

#### Diverse Exposure and Experience
- Technical breadth
- Learn 10 different caching products, not just 1
  - Be able to compare between the options

#### Have Business Domain Knowledge
- Technical expertise coupled with strong knowledge of the business domain
- Communicate with C-level executives and
business users

#### Possess Interpersonal Skills
- "No matter what they tell you, it’s always a people problem.” - [Gerald Weinberg](https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Gerald_Weinberg)
- Leadership skills

#### Understand and Navigate Politics
- Negotiation and navigating office politics
