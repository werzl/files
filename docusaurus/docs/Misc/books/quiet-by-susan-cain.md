  - Brain scans show less activity in decision making parts of the brain when "conforming" - Perceptions change
  - People don't know they're doing it, its unconscious

## Chapter 4 - Is Temperment Destiny?
- Babies were tested and accurately identified as introverts/extroverts
- The Amygdala in the brain controls how reactive to stimuli we are
  - Introverted babies reacted highly to things like noise and cotton swabs dipped in alcohol - they were more likely to be introverts when grown up
  - Things like meeting new people or public speaking activate the Amygdala


## Chapter 5 - Beyond Temperment

## Chapter 9 - When Should we Pretend to be Extroverted?
- The extrovert ideal is real. Most of us 'pretend' and it forwards our careers
- Free Trait Theory
  - Free Trait Theory, developed by Brian Little, proposes that while we have inherent, fixed personality traits (like introversion), we also adopt "free traits"—temporary behaviors out of character—to pursue important personal projects, balancing our nature with our goals, though prolonged use requires restorative niches to avoid burnout
