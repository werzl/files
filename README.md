# files
A bunch of handy files I use across different projects.
This repo’s basically a toolbox — scripts, configs, and other useful stuff I’ve picked up or put together to make dev life a bit easier. Feel free to poke around or grab anything that helps!

## Docs
This is the docs site for my files repo — built with Docusaurus.
It’s where I keep notes, guides, and other dev-related stuff that I want to remember or share. Think of it as my digital notebook.
