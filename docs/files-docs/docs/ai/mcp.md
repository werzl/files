# MCP (Model Context Protocol)

Invented by Anthropic. Spec: https://modelcontextprotocol.io/specification/2025-03-26

## MCP Rollout in Software Companies
Big Tech Companies are developing their own MCP servers / connectors or exposing existing LLM SDKs via MCP. For example, Google implemented it in their CIDER IDE.

As of 2025, Microsoft / Amazon are rolling out MCP integrations in "most of" their internal tooling.
